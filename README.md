# Data-science-industry-task-sheet
A task sheet for a data science company I completed in R, producing a fine-looking RMarkdown document at the end of it all. 
A few folk from the UK will probably recognise the company by  the tasks done. 
They were kind enough not to bother me with any feedback, after I spent several days of my Summer holiday completing this test. Any feedback on this work would be very appreciated!
